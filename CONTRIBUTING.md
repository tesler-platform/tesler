# Contributing to the Tesler

Many thanks to everyone who helps improve project! :tada:

## Creating issues

Developing a platform is difficult to track down errors during the development process, as well as to think through all the use cases. The easiest way to contribute to the development of the project is to fix a new requirement or create an issue. When creating a request, in order to avoid duplicates, please make sure that no such requests have been created, and also read the documentation (maybe there you will find the answer to the question). We are always happy to competently composed requests and are grateful for them!

## Pull requests

Each pull request created by the community greatly helps the development of the project. We are always happy to receive pull requests from you, even if this is a small fix for a typo. Significant improvements that change the concept of the project, it is better to previously discuss with the platform team in order to find a common view on how to solve the problem.

## Participate in Reviews

Helping to review pull requests is another great way to contribute. Your feedback can help to shape the implementation of new features. When reviewing pull requests, however, please refrain from approving or rejecting a PR unless you are in a team of Tesler.

## Branch organization 

Major versions are realesed from master branch marked with a corresponding tag.  
Minor versions are merged into "develop" branch first.  
Features and bugfixes should be named in `feature/issue-number` format.
